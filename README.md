# The Past Project: Spanish Armada
> This repository contains an educational project that explores a turning point in Tudor history: the conflict between England and the Spanish Armada. Following a non-linear narrative model, an interactive player interest storyboard game is used to examine the causes and effects of the Spanish Armada’s defeat by England. Players gain an appreciation of radical shift in power that transformed England into a major global leader and altered the course of colonialism around the world for centuries.

## General Information
- The intended audience includes secondary level students and teachers who can use a digital history game as an educational, fun tool. The game immerses players within a multi-leveled historical account about the motives for key decisions made by the major figures in the medieval maritime conflict, including England, Spain, and the Papacy. The purpose of the project is to give students an appreciation of the challenging problems and difficult decisions that shape history. Teachers may find the game to be a useful tool to show that history is more than a set of facts, since a historical narrative uses facts but which facts get included and how the facts are presented matters since these decisions affect how a story is perceived.

## Technologies Used
- Twine - version 2.7.1
- Harlowe - version 3.3.0
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Features
- Embedded historical images available with Creative Commons-licenses from Wikimedia Commons
- A changing variable value based on the number of coins that are collected or cashed in as the player makes a decision about rewards
- A key to unlock a reward in terms of coins that the player collects as coins while the game is played 
- The use of conditional statements to determine whether or not a player has met the coin amount needed to unlock the reward
- A player name variable that personalizes name messages throughout the passages and a special message that only displays to a player who enters the name Elizabeth in honor of the Tudor queen.
-User input macros where the player must decide what option to follow and deal with the consequences of the choice

## Project Status
This project is considered complete based on the digital project requirements set by my George Mason University history course (HIST 390: Tech & the Tudors).
## Room for Improvement
The storyboard can be enhanced to create a richer immersive player experience.

Room for improvement:
- One improvement would be to add more images, background color, and font color or style that can make the passages more visually engaging.
- A second improvement would be to add music to complement the content of the passages.
- A third improvement would be to add more passages that provide better context about the Spanish Armada battle, such as decisions made by the Duke of Medina and information about what the surviving Armada sailors dealt with when they returned to Spain.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the Spanish Armada portions from the book Early Modern England 1485 - 1714 (3rd Edition) by Robert Bucholz and Newton Key along with class lectures by Dr. Jessica Otis at George Mason University’s HIST 390: Tech & the Tudors.
- This project also relied on Twine tutorials by Adam Hammond (https://www.adamhammond.com/twineguide/) and Alison Parrish (https://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/).
- Many thanks to Dr. Jessica Otis at George Mason University for her support, instructions, and encouragement and my fellow classmates in HIST 390: Tech & the Tudors for their tips, feedback, and encouragement too.
